Known Issue: The Editor may refuse to save some values to the config. I have added a workaround for such a case. Navigate to Assets/VehicleConfigs, find your specific config and change the value fom there.  It should save. 

HOW TO USE:

1. Go to releases and download the latest or oldest Unity Package.
2. Import this package or drag and drop it ino your Assets folder.
3. Create a folder named Editor if none exists and move everything but Vehicle Config to the Editor.
4. Move the Vehicle Config to Assets.
5. To access the editor, navigate to your Top Bar, notice Tools has ben added *If this is a new project wth no existing tools*

WHAT TO REMEMBER:
1. This tool only works with prefabs in the Assets folder, NOT in the gameScene.
2. Your vehicle must be tagged with "vehicle".
3. The tool has only but a few features for now.
