Important to Note: The vehicle category may refuse to save to config. If thi happens, Just navigate to Assets/VehicleConfig and find your VehicleConfig for your car and change from there. 
I am working on th sue as of now along with other smaller issues.

HOW TO USE:

1. Go to releases and download the latest or oldest Unity Package. Or alternatively, download the code directly from here.
[You can skip step 2 if you di th alternative]
2. Import this package or drag and drop it ino your Assets folder.
3. Create a folder named Editor if none exists and move everything but Vehicle Config to the Editor.
[If you used the alternative method, just copy and pate everything as is to your assets folder. Plz note he release is a bi behind. So it's not up to date as with h code on here.]
4. Move the Vehicle Config to Assets.
5. Below is a link for th yt video on how to use thi tool: 

WHAT TO REMEMBER:
1. This tool only works with prefabs in the Assets folder, NOT in the gameScene.
2. Your vehicle must be tagged with "vehicle".
3. The tool has only but a few features for now.
